# 🧠 Image Classification using CNN

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images into categories using TensorFlow/Keras. It covers data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation using visualizations.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- Loads and preprocesses an image dataset
- Builds a CNN model with Conv, Pool, Dense, and Dropout layers
- Trains the model on image data
- Evaluates accuracy and loss over epochs
- Visualizes predictions and confusion matrix

---

## 📊 Dataset

- The dataset consists of images categorized into multiple classes (e.g., cats/dogs, digits, fashion, etc.)
- Images are resized, normalized, and augmented for training
- ⚠️ _Dataset not included due to size or licensing — please add it manually as per your use case._
